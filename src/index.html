                <li><strong>Word By Word</strong> (2023)
                    <p>This is a simple C program game for 2 players that displays words one by one, and you need to memorize them as you write the whole sentence to make your answer right and proceed to the next level. This project was submitted as a group final project for Computer Programming 1.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>ATM Simulation</strong> (2023)
                    <p>This ATM simulation program is developed using C++. It mimics the functionalities of an actual ATM by utilizing a flash drive as an ATM card. This program allows users to perform various transactions, including withdrawing, depositing, and transferring money. This project was submitted as a group project for Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Text Compressor and Decompressor</strong> (2023)
                    <p>This project implements a text compressor and decompressor using Huffman coding. The compressor efficiently reduces the size of text files by encoding characters based on their frequency of occurrence, while the decompressor reconstructs the original text from the compressed data. Both functionalities are developed using C++. This project was submitted as a group project for Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>
